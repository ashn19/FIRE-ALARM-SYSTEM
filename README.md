## FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
Fire and Gas detection alarm systems are important tools for safeguarding our residence home, building, office, market, and otherplaces. A well designed fire and gas system is intended to detect and in some cases automatically mitigate fire, flammable gas and toxic gas hazards.
Proper placement of detectors is critical in the design of a fire and gas system to ensure that coverage is adequate to detect hazards at their incipient stage, in order to prevent escalation. 
The rates of increase in the fire alarm algorithm to determine the presence of a fire has been rapid. The smoke sensor provides a mean to detect smoke and to serve as an early fire warning. 
This Arduino project is of home automation and safety. In this project we design an system to detect the presence of gas by using a gas sensor.We indicate it by using a LCD display.

### METHODOLOGY
This paper describes the design of a fire alarm system with Arduino-based  means of GSM Module.AÂ fire alarm systemÂ is a device that detects the presence ofÂ gasesÂ in an area, often as part of aÂ safety system. This type of equipment is used to detect aÂ gas leakÂ or other emissions and can interface with aÂ control systemÂ so a process can be automatically shut down.Gas detectors can be used to detectÂ combustible,Â flammableÂ andÂ toxicÂ gases, andÂ oxygenÂ depletion.So in order to avoid any hazard due fire and gas leakage in a petrochemical industry we have designed an integrated system which will monitor timely gas leakage in any area around the plant using Arduino which is a wireless communication device. .The system detects the leakage of LPG using the gas sensor and sends a response which activates the alarm.It will immediately display an alert notification on LCD display upon the  rise in temperature.This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals.A gas detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. Results from the test are documented and discussed. Through this system, it can help users to improve their safety standards by having immediate response in preventing accidents. This will eventually allow the users to protect their lives and the properties as well from the disaster.
